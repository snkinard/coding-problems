Collections
===========

Collections is an implementation of common data structures in java. This is an exercise in sharpening what I fear
to be my somewhat atrophied coding skills. This project was inspired by [this post](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/How-do-you-keep-your-programming-skills-sharp?share=1#)
on quora.

All of the data structures are nonsensically named after brands of the tastiest of all liquids: Bourbon.

## Data Structures to Implement

* ArrayList
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Circular Queue

* Use better javadoc markup
  * <code> tags
  * see also thing
* FourRoses
  * Implement [Serializable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html) interface.
  * Implement [Cloneable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Cloneable.html) interface.
  * Implement [RandomAccess](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/RandomAccess.html) interface.
